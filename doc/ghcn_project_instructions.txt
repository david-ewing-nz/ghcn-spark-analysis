Project Instructions for ChatGPT Assistance

1. Clarify Key Concepts:

- Provide a brief explanation of the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) dataset and its structure (e.g., .dly files, station metadata, key variables like PRCP, SNOW, TMAX, TMIN).
- Explain the basics of Hadoop and how it can process large climate datasets.
- Describe how Azure can be used to manage and analyze these datasets (e.g., using Azure HDInsight for Hadoop clusters or Azure Storage for data management).

2. Code Development:

- Assist in writing Python code to:
  - Parse and extract relevant data from .dly files.
  - Use Hadoopâ€™s MapReduce framework to perform data aggregation tasks like calculating average temperature, total precipitation, or identifying trends.
  - Interface with Azure for uploading, storing, and accessing data files.
  - Generate functions for error handling, logging, and validating dataset consistency.

3. Data Preparation and Handling:

- Help write scripts to preprocess the dataset, such as:
  - Filtering data based on specific criteria (e.g., geographic region or time period).
  - Converting data into a format suitable for Hadoop processing (e.g., CSV or JSON).
- Provide advice on handling missing data or flagged quality issues in the dataset.

4. Research and Optimization:

- Research potential methodologies for analyzing climate datasets, including examples or case studies.
- Suggest ways to optimize the MapReduce job performance, such as combiner functions or partitioning.

5. Debugging and Troubleshooting:

- Debug Python code for errors and inconsistencies.
- Analyze any issues that arise during Hadoop processing or Azure integration and provide solutions.

6. Documentation:

- Draft clear, concise documentation that explains:
  - The overall workflow of the project.
  - How the Python code functions.
  - Steps for deploying the solution using Hadoop and Azure.
- Provide templates or examples for documenting data analysis findings.

7. Iterative Refinement:

- Facilitate discussions on potential improvements or alternative approaches based on initial results.
- Iterate over code or workflow to meet specific project requirements or goals.
